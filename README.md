# AWS - Integration IAM Role
The Zesty journey starts with a 5-minute onboarding in which the customer [signs up](https://app.zesty.co/home/register) to Zesty Platform and provides a Read-Only IAM Role.  

Zesty does not store any private keys, passwords, or authentication tokens.  
The authentication is made based on the [IAM Cross Account Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html) alog with External ID that provides two-factor authentication.

Our integration IAM Role provides read-only access to the metadata about the running resources in your AWS account.  
We never access any of your company or customerâ€™s data.  

This step will allow Zesty to populate the Live Cloud Cost Dashboard and display within minutes an estimation of the potential savings using Zesty Automation.
